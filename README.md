# FizzBuzzKata

Fizz Buzz is a counting and number substitution game mainly aimed at teaching children division. Players take turns counting up from one, replacing any number that is divisible by three with the word 'fizz', any number divisible by five with the word 'buzz', and any number divisible by both three and five to be replaced with 'fizz buzz'.

## Feature 1 - Basic Fizz Buzz Scoring
You'll be getting used to this by now. Once again, we need a backend for the game that can correctly score the game we're implementing on the front end. It needs to be a reusable library that simply takes a number, and returns the correct answer for that number- whether that is the number itself, 'fizz', 'buzz', or 'fizz buzz'.

## Feature 2 - Playing FizzBuzz Variations
   Turns out that Fizz Buzz has a whole bunch of variants that people play in different countries and for different ages of children. One of the most interesting we have seen is Fizz Buzz Pop, where the word 'pop' is substituted for numbers that are a multiple of seven. We want you to extend the rules of our current Fizz Buzz game to allow players to play Fizz Buzz Pop instead.

## Feature 3 - Creating Fizz Buzz Variations
   So not that many people have actually heard of or played Fizz Buzz Pop, probably because the substitution words are different in different countries across the world. We're going to give players the ability to create their own substitution words and link them to multiples of certain numbers, and we need you to make this possible.
